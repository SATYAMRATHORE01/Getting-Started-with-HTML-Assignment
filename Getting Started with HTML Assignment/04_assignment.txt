Tag:-
 A tag in HTML is a set of characters enclosed in angle brackets `< >` that specifies how an element should be formatted or structured on a web page. HTML tags are used to define the beginning and end of elements.

For example:

    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
 
    In this example, `<p>` is the opening tag, and `</p>` is the closing tag, defining a paragraph element.

Element:-	
 An element in HTML consists of both the opening and closing tags along with the content enclosed between them. It represents a distinct part of a web page's structure or content. 

Using the previous example:

  			  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    

    Here, `<p>` is the opening tag, `This is a paragraph.` is the content, and `</p>` is the closing tag, together forming the paragraph element.
