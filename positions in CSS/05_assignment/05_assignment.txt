         Z-index is a CSS property used to control the stacking order of positioned elements on a web page.

Purpose:- 
        It determines which element appears in front of or behind other elements when they overlap in the same stacking context.

Usage:-
        Elements with higher z-index values are displayed on top of elements with lower values.

Stacking Context:- 
        Each element with a position property other than `static` creates its own stacking context, and z-index values are relative within that context.

Default:- 
        By default, elements have a z-index of `auto`, and their stacking order is based on their position in the HTML document flow.

Negative Values:-
        Negative z-index values can be used to place an element behind elements with positive values, useful for layering and overlays.
