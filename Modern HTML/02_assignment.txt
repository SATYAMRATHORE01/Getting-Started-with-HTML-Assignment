
    HTML entities are special codes or sequences used to display reserved or special characters in HTML documents. These entities ensure that characters with special meanings in HTML, such as <, >, &, ", and ', are displayed correctly. Here are five common HTML entities:

1. `&lt;` - Represents the less-than sign (<).
2. `&gt;` - Represents the greater-than sign (>).
3. `&amp;` - Represents the ampersand (&).
4. `&quot;` - Represents a double quotation mark (").
5. `&apos;` - Represents a single quotation mark (').
