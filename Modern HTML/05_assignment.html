             <header>  <h1>Features of HTML 5</h1></header> 
                <p>
                    HTML5, the latest version of the HyperText Markup Language, introduced several new features and elements to enhance web development and create more feature-rich and interactive websites. Here is a list of some of the key features of HTML5:
</p>

<p><b>
(1).  Semantic Elements: </b> HTML5 introduced a set of new semantic elements that provide better structure to web documents, making it easier for both developers and search engines to understand the content. These elements include &lt;header&gt, &lt;nav&gt, &lt;article&gt, &lt;section&gt, &lt;aside&gt, &lt;footer&gt, and more.
</p>

<p><b>
(2).  Audio and Video: </b> HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content using the &lt;audio&gt and &lt;video&gt elements, reducing the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

</p>

<p><b>
(3). Canvas: </b> The &lt;canvas&gt element allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes, images, and animations directly in the browser without the need for plugins. </p>

<p><b>
(4). Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG): </b> HTML5 supports SVG for creating vector graphics that can be scaled and animated. This is particularly useful for logos, icons, and complex graphics. </p>

<p><b>
    (5). Responsive Web Design: </b> HTML5, in combination with CSS3, provides tools for creating responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. </p>

    <p><b>
(6). Web Accessibility: </b> HTML5 includes features that support accessibility, making it easier to create web content that is inclusive and usable by people with disabilities.
